Added functionality (by SiNiSTER)


Rootkit (add you own and name it ag.exe, mine is priv)
added flexibility to cftp (CFTPPath)
added notification to cftp, messages transferchannel when it has exploited a host
just as ftp commands are being issued
More vnc passwords
bot now shuts down many firewalls and a/v software on hosts just before download and infection using net stop via cmd

Netapi spreading (not yet verified to be working)


parameters for certain rootkits must be set in main.cpp in call to shellexecute to hide neccessary procs and files
Nothing too special as of yet but
More still to come.....
